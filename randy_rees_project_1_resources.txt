Project 1 resources:

I built basic websites before so just needed a refresher for this project. Below are the resources that helped me:

- Udacity course "Intro to HTML and CSS"
- Sitepoint book "Build Your Own Website The Right Way Using HTML & CSS" by Ian Lloyd
- The website http://www.w3schools.com/
- The MDN website https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
- Used the website http://getbootstrap.com/css/
- Udacity course "How to Use Git and GitHub"

I achieved a 0% mismatch on my test run.
